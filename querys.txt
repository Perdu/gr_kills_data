** Recreate db:
drop table kill_logs; drop table weapon;
sudo mariadb -u root < create_db.sql && sudo mariadb -u root gr_kills < load_data.sql

** Kills by weapon:
select name, count(*) as a from kill_logs join weapon on weapon_id = weapon.id group by weapon_id order by a desc;

** Kills of weapon:
select name, count(*) as a from kill_logs join weapon on weapon_killed_id = weapon.id group by weapon_killed_id order by a desc;

** Nb games:
select count(distinct game_id) from kill_logs;

** Fill kill_logs_full (too long):
INSERT INTO kill_logs_full (id, killer_hash, killed_hash, game_id, weapon_id, kill_date, weapon_killed_id) select id, killer_hash, killed_hash as a, game_id, weapon_id, kill_date b, (SELECT weapon_id from kill_logs where killer_hash = a and kill_date = (SELECT MAX(kill_date) from kill_logs where killer_hash = a and kill_date < b) limit 1) from kill_logs;

select count(*) from kill_logs where killed_hash not in (select unique killer_hash from kill_logs);

** Nb of killed players who don't have a kill:
